# AI Collaboration Guidelines

Automated assistants working in this repository should follow the conventions below before generating or editing content.

## Naming Rules

- Always spell `jammin` in lowercase, even at sentence starts, headings, or product names such as `jammin cli`, `jammin studio`, and `jammin inspect`.
- Preserve existing casing for other product names (e.g., `typeberry`, `Polkajam`, `JAMNP`).

## Style Expectations

- Prefer concise, task-focused prose with short paragraphs.
- Align terminology with the documentation set in `docs/src`; when in doubt, reference `docs/src/jammin-suite.md` for the canonical wording of suite components.
- Update `docs/src/SUMMARY.md` whenever new pages are added so the mdBook navigation stays accurate.
- Use direct, plain language that reads like an experienced (non-native) open source developer explaining the work. Avoid marketing fluff or overly formal sentences; keep the tone practical and grounded.

Consult this file at the start of every AI-assisted session to ensure the repository stays stylistically consistent.
